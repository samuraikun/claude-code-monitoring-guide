# Claude Code Monitoring Guide

A guide for collecting and visualizing telemetry data from Claude Code to monitor costs, efficiency, and anomalies.

[日本語](README_JA.md)

## Architecture

```
Claude Code
  │  (OTLP gRPC / localhost:4317)
  ▼
OpenTelemetry Collector
  ├─ metrics ──▶ Prometheus (:9090)
  ├─ logs    ──▶ Loki (:3100)
  └─ traces  ──▶ Tempo (:3200)
                    ▲
                Grafana (:3000) ─ unified visualization across all data sources
```

Claude Code attaches a `prompt.id` (UUID v4) to every event. This ID is the key to tracing the entire processing flow from `user_prompt → api_request → tool_result`.

## Prerequisites

- Docker / Docker Compose
- Claude Code installed

## Setup

### 1. Start the Monitoring Stack

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samuraikun/claude-code-monitoring-guide
cd claude-code-monitoring-guide
docker compose up -d
```

Services started:

| Service | Port | Role |
|---|---|---|
| OpenTelemetry Collector | 4317 (gRPC), 4318 (HTTP) | Receives and forwards telemetry |
| Prometheus | 9090 | Metrics storage |
| Loki | 3100 | Log/event storage |
| Tempo | 3200 | Trace storage |
| Grafana | 3000 | Visualization (admin/admin) |

### 2. Configure Claude Code Telemetry

When you launch `claude` in this repository, telemetry is automatically enabled via `.claude/settings.json`.

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY": "1",
    "OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER": "otlp",
    "OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER": "otlp",
    "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL": "grpc",
    "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT": "http://localhost:4317",
    "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_TEMPORALITY_PREFERENCE": "cumulative"
  }
}
```

To use this in other repositories, add the same configuration to `~/.claude/settings.json` (global settings).

### 3. Verify

```bash
# Start Claude Code and do some work
claude

# Check if data is arriving at Loki
curl -s http://localhost:3100/loki/api/v1/labels | jq .

# View logs in Grafana: http://localhost:3000
# Explore → Loki → {service_name="claude-code"}
```

## Grafana Dashboards

After starting Grafana, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and the following dashboards will be automatically provisioned in the **Claude Code** folder.

## Key Metrics and Log Events

Claude Code sends the following events via OTLP:

| Event | Description |
|---|---|
| `user_prompt` | Prompt submission. Includes `prompt_id` / `session_id` / `prompt_length` |
| `api_request` | API request. Includes `model` / `cost_usd` / `duration_ms` / `input_tokens` / `output_tokens` / `cache_read_tokens` / `cache_creation_tokens` / `speed` |
| `tool_result` | Tool execution result. Includes `tool_name` / `success` / `duration_ms` / `tool_result_size_bytes` |
| `api_error` | API error. Includes `status_code` / `attempt` / `prompt_id` |
| `tool_decision` | Tool execution approval/rejection. Includes `decision` (accept/reject) / `source` (config/user_reject/etc.) |

Basic Loki queries:

```logql
# View all events
{service_name="claude-code"} | json | drop __error__, __error_details__

# Trace events for a specific prompt_id
{service_name="claude-code"} | json | drop __error__, __error_details__ | prompt_id=`<your-prompt-id>`

# Filter only tool failures
{service_name="claude-code"} | json | drop __error__, __error_details__ | event_name=`tool_result` | success=`false`
```

## Troubleshooting

See [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md) for details.

**Common issues**:

- **No data arriving at Loki**: Check that `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=otlp` is set
- **Inaccurate Prometheus values**: `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_TEMPORALITY_PREFERENCE=cumulative` is required
- **Telemetry not enabled**: Run `docker compose ps` to verify containers are running and `curl http://localhost:4317` to check the port is open
